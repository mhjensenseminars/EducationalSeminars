    "\n",
    "* Educate the next generation of school teachers and university teachers,  with a strong focus on digital competences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unique opportunities\n",
    "Computing competence represents a central element\n",
    "in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to\n",
    "essentially almost all advanced problems in modern\n",
    "societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing competence **enlarges the body of tools available to students** and\n",
    "scientists beyond classical tools and **allows for a more generic\n",
    "handling of problems**. Focusing on algorithmic aspects **results in\n",
    "deeper insights** about scientific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing in science courses allows us to bring important elements of scientific methods at a much earlier stage in our students' education.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It gives the students skills and abilities that are asked for by society.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It gives us as university teachers a unique opportunity to enhance students' insights about our disciplines and how to solve scientific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing competence\n",
    "**Computing means solving scientific problems using all possible tools**, including symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical paper and pencil solutions .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing is about developing an understanding of the scientific method** by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the part of students, this competence involves being able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,\n",
    "\n",
    "* derive, verify, and implement algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand what can go wrong with algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "* use these algorithms to construct reproducible scientific outcomes and to engage in science in ethical ways, and\n",
    "\n",
    "* think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Better understanding of the scientific method\n",
    "All these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process *per se*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem\n",
    "as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying\n",
    "general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a\n",
    "general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of\n",
    "computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or\n",
    "numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This\n",
    "generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for\n",
    "understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a\n",
    "particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should basic university education undergo a shift towards modern computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Much of the development of **methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods  for discrete models** in science and industry, simply because **much larger classes of problems can be addressed** with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why should basic university education undergo a shift towards modern computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is computing competence important?\n",
    "The impact of the computer on mathematics and science is tremendous: **science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing**.\n",
    "* Computing can increase the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing through programming can be excellent training of creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing can enhance the understanding of abstractions and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing can decrease the need for special tricks and tedious algebra, and shifts the focus to problem definition, visualization, and \"what if\" discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disasters attributable to poor management of code and more\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you been paying attention in your numerical analysis or scientific computation courses? If not, it could be a costly mistake. Here are some real life examples of what can happen when numerical algorithms are not correctly applied.\n",

    "1. [The Patriot Missile failure](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html), in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, on February 25, 1991 which resulted in 28 deaths, is ultimately attributable to poor handling of rounding errors.\n",

[The sinking of the Sleipner A](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/sleipner.html) offshore platform in Gandsfjorden near Stavanger, Norway, on August 23, 1991, resulted in a loss of nearly one billion dollars.
