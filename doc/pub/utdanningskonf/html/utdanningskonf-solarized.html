<p>
<p>Active learning can be defined as an approach to learning wherein the
students engage themselves in the learning process by developing
knowledge and understanding. It demands full-fledged participation on
the part of the learner and is not based on classroom teaching, rather
it is based on interactive learning sessions.

<h2 id="passive-learning">Passive Learning </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>Passive Learning means the traditional form of learning wherein teachers are seen as experts and they are expected to transfer knowledge to the learners. Hence, the students have a laid-back attitude, as they learn from what is taught to them by their instructor. Moreover, the student does normally not get any feedback from the instructor.</p>
</div>


<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>There is growing evidence that an active learning environment leads to deeper insights and knowledge</p>

<b>Some standard elements in  project-based courses (PBC)</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li> The audiences for projects are generally at the university</li>
<li> Are traditionally more about the end-product and less about the learning and process</li>
<li> The project is pre-planned and clear</li>
<li> The project is based on specific directions and criteria</li>
<li> The project can be done at home without teacher guidance or collaboration</li>
<li> The project can be outlined in details</li>
<li> Can be  less open-ended and more uniform</li>
<li> Projects are <em>turned in</em> rather than <em>published</em>, presented, or otherwise managed on an ongoing basis. They are normally graded</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Some standard elements in  project-based learning (PBL)</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li> In PBL, the audience is generally outside the university/school</li>
<li> PBL includes <em>need to knows</em> and progress checkpoints</li>
<li> Input from peers, teachers, community members, experts, and others can help guide and improve the project</li>
<li> The <em>teacher work</em> is done mainly before and during the process itself</li>
<li> PBL Is often based on a driving question and ongoing inquiry, discovery, and iteration</li>
<li> PBL depends on background knowledge, learner choice, technology tools, support from others, and dozens of other factors that result in a process of learning that produces very different results and projects</li>
</ol>
<p>PBL requires a lot of planning in advance and coordination of teaching teams an students.  My experience is that this applies to PBC as well.</p>

<h2 id="research-based-teaching">Research based Teaching </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>How do we define it?</b>
<p>

<p>One possible definition: It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.
</p>

<ol>
<li> It is the standard situation at all universities  and takes normally place at the senior undergraduate/graduate level (isn't it too late?)</li>
<li> It is seldom done in undergraduate courses.</li>
<li> Taught by a researcher</li>
<li> The student starts seeing the countour of the scientific approach leading her/him to make new interpretations, develop new insights and understandings that lead  to further research.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="more-on-research-based-education">More on Research based Education  </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>What should the education contain?</b>
<p>
<p>The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:</p>
<ol>
<li> Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry</li>
<li> To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers on closed form. Solve real problems.</li>
<li> Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.</li>
<li> Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our education should reflect this.</p>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Normal workflow in Science and Engineering</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li> A problem is properly described using a precise (normal) language.</li>
<li> It is translated to a mathematical problem using known laws and principles.</li>
<li> It is solved, normally via numerical similations.</li>
<li> The solution is visualized and analyzed.</li>
<li> The solution to the problem is formulated.</li>
</ol>
<p>People who master these skills bring an important compentence to society. Gain via increased efficiency and quality due to interdisciplinarity at a more detailed level. </p>
