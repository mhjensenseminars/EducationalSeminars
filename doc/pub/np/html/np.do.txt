===== Motivation  =====
!bblock
* Develop structured modules which will provide our students with a modern education in nuclear physics
* Modules/courses should contain a high-level of synchronization
* A computational perspective is essential
* The FRIB theory center can function as the national coordinating unit
* Coordination with the "Nuclear TALENT":"http://www.nucleartalent.org" initiative

===== Local situation at MSU  =====
!bblock

We have at MSU a  
* "basic survey course PHY802":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~witek/Classes/PHY802/NuclPhys802-2015.html"  and three basic nuclear physics courses 
* "structure":"http://nuclearstructure.github.io/PHY981/doc/web/course.html", 
* "reactions and dynamics":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~nunes/phy982/phy982web2015.htm"  and 
* _Nuclear Astrophysics_. 

These three basic courses have a duration each  of 30-40 hours (2-3 credits).   

They can be taught as a regular one-semester course or half-semester course. There are also experimental courses not discussed here.

===== Advanced  modules, Nuclear Talent  =====
!bblock 
o Nuclear forces (INT 2013, new version 2017)
o Many-body methods (_GANIL July 2015_)
o Few-body methods for nuclear physics (_ECT* July-August 2015_)
o Density functional theory and self-consistent methods (ECT* 2014 and _York 2016_)
o Theory for exploring nuclear structure experiments (GANIL 2014)
o Theory for exploring nuclear reaction experiments (GANIL 2013)
o Nuclear theory for astrophysics (MSU 2014 and _INT 2015_)
o Theoretical approaches to describe  exotic nuclei (planned for 2016, Chalmers, Gothenburg)
o High-performance computing and computational tools for nuclear physics
  * ECT* 2012, Shell model and variational Monte Carlo

For all courses (till this year) we have had on average 40 applicants per course.

===== To think of =====
!bblock 
* How many basic courses can an institution offer, and which courses should be offered?
* How can the coming FRIB theory center be used to coordinate an advanced training in nuclear physics?
* Can we integrate the (*ad hoc*) Nuclear Talent courses/initiative  in our education? 
* _Nuclear Talent initiative and Asia_ 
* Most courses offered are theoretical ones. We need a better coordination between theory and experiment. Should we think of an experimental Talent initiative? 
* Is it possible to integrate material developed in different Talent courses, offering thereby a coherent source for educating the next generation of nuclear physicists? Keyword: Modularization of topics.
