===== Motivation  =====
!bblock 
* Develop structured modules which will provide our students with a modern education in nuclear physics
* Modules/courses should contain a high-level of synchronization
* A computational perspective is essential
* They should form a basic curriculum to be integrated with the coming FRIB theory center
* Coordination with Talent initiative and other Northern American institutions to be elaborated

We have at MSU a  "basic survey course PHY802":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~witek/Classes/PHY802/NuclPhys802-2015.html"  and three basic nuclear physics courses "structure":"http://nuclearstructure.github.io/PHY981/doc/web/course.html", "reactions and dynamics":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~nunes/phy982/phy982web2015.htm"  and _Nuclear Astrophysics_. These three basic courses
have a duration each  of 30-40 hours (2-3 credits).   

They can be taught as a regular one-semester course or half-semester course. There are also experimental courses not discussed here.

===== Discussion =====
!bblock 
* How many basic courses can an institution offer, and which courses should be offered?
* How can the coming FRIB theory center be used to coordinate an advanced training in nuclear physics?
* Can we integrate the (*ad hoc*) Nuclear Talent courses/initiative  in our education? 
* Most courses offered are theoretical ones. We need a better coordination between theory and experiment. Should we think of an experimental Talent initiative?
