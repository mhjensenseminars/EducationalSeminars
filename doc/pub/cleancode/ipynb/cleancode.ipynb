    "Have you been paying attention in your numerical analysis or scientific computation courses? If not, it could be a costly mistake. Here are some real life examples of what can happen when numerical algorithms are not correctly applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [The Patriot Missile failure](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html), in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, on February 25, 1991 which resulted in 28 deaths, is ultimately attributable to poor handling of rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [The explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane.html) just after lift-off on its maiden voyage off French Guiana, on June 4, 1996, was ultimately the consequence of a simple overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [The sinking of the Sleipner A](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/sleipner.html) offshore platform in Gandsfjorden near Stavanger, Norway, on August 23, 1991, resulted in a loss of nearly one billion dollars. It was found to be the result of inaccurate finite element analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is computing competence important and clean code important?\n",
    "**Definition of computing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "With computing I will mean solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical, analytical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems. Well written code is a piece of art by itself and expresses clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing competence, what is it?\n",
    "Computing competence has always been a central part of the science and engineering education. Traditionally, such competence meant mastering mathematical methods to solve science problems - by pen and paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today **we** are expected to use all available tools to solve scientific problems; computers primarily, but also pen and paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the term/word algorithms in the broad meaning:  methods (for example mathematical) to solve science problems, with and without computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous versus discrete\n",
    "Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the development of methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and industry, simply because much larger problem classes can be addressed with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies. However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key principle in scientific modeling\n",
    "The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing competence is central to solving scientific problems\n",
    "**Definition of computing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing competence represents a central element in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to essentially almost all advanced problems in modern societies. Computing competence is simply central to further progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in deeper insights about scientific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's project in science and industry tend to involve larger teams. Tools for reliable collaboration must therefore be mastered (e.g., version control systems, automated computer experiments for reproducibility, software and method documentation).   **In order to be efficient and to have code which can be extended upon, clean code matters even more**.\n",
