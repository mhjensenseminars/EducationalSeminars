    "* Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Much of the development of **methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods  for discrete models** in science and industry, simply because **much larger classes of problems can be addressed** with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies.\n",

    "So, why should basic university education undergo a shift towards modern computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is computing competence important?\n",
    "The impact of the computer on mathematics and science is tremendous: **science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing**.\n",
    "* Computing can increase the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing through programming can be excellent training of creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing can enhance the understanding of abstractions and generalization.\n",
