\subsection{Modeling and computations as a way to enhance algorithminc thinking}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

Algorithmic  thinking as a way to

\begin{itemize}
\item Enhance instruction based teaching

\item Introduce Research based teaching  from day one

\item Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines 

\item Validation and verification of scientific results (the PRL example), with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central.

\item Good working practices from day one.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Research based teaching}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{How do we define it?}
One possible definition: It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.


\begin{itemize}
\item It is the standard situation at all universities  and takes normally place at the senior undergraduate/graduate level (isn't it too late?)

\item It is seldom done in undergraduate courses.

\item Taught by a researcher

\item The student starts seeing the countour of the scientific approach leading her/him to make new interpretations, develop new insights and understandings that lead  to further research.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---





% !split
\subsection{Research based education}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{What should the education contain?}
The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:

\begin{itemize}
\item Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry

\item To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers on closed form. Solve real problems.

\item Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.

\item Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Our education should reflect this.

\subsection{Research based education}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Normal workflow in Science and Engineering.}

\begin{itemize}
\item A problem is properly described using a precise (normal) language.

\item It is translated to a mathematical problem using known laws and  principles.

\item It is solved, normally via numerical similations.

\item The solution is visualized and analyzed.

\item The solution to the problem is formulated.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
People who master these skills bring an important compentence to society.

\subsection{Preliminary summary}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Computations should enter basic science education.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Computation is a fundamental tool to gain new insights and should be included in our elementary teaching.

\item Requires development of algorithmic thinking.

\item Basic numerical methods should be part of the compulsory curriculum.

\item The students should also learn to develop new numerical methods and adapt to new software tools.

\item Requires more training than simple programming in a mathematics course.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Can we catch many birds with one stone?}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
\item How can we include and integrate an algorithmic (computational) perspective   in our basic education?

\item Can this enhance the students' understanding of mathematics and science?

\item Can it strengthen research based teaching?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% !split
\subsection{What is needed?}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Programming.}
A compulsory programming course with a strong mathematical flavour. \emph{Should give a solid foundation in programming as a problem solving technique in mathematics}. Programming is understanding! The line of thought when solving mathematical problems numerically enhances algorithmic thinking,  and thereby the students' understanding of the scientific process.
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Mathematics and numerics.}
Mathematics is at least as important as before, but should be supplemented with development, analysis, implementation, verification and validation of numerical methods. Science ethics and better understanding of the pedagogical process, almost for free!
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Sciences.}
Training in modelling and problem solving with numerical methods and visualisation, as well as traditional methods in Science courses, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Engineering...
% --- end paragraph admon ---





% !split
\subsection{Implementation}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Crucial ingredients.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Support from governing bodies (now priority 1 of the College of Natural Science at UOslo)

\item Cooperation across departmental boundaries

\item Willingness by individuals to give priority to teaching reform
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Consensus driven approach.
% --- end paragraph admon ---





% !split
\subsection{Implementation in Oslo: The CSE  project}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{What we do.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coordinated use of computational exercises and numerical tools in most undergraduate courses.

\item Help update the scientific staff's competence on computational aspects and give support (scientific, pedagogical and financial)  to those who wish to revise  their courses in a computational direction.

\item Teachers get good summer students to aid in introducing computational exercises

\item Develop courses and exercise modules with a computational perspective, both for students and teachers. 

\item Basic idea: mixture of mathematics, computation, informatics and topics from the physical sciences.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Interesting outcome: higher focus on teaching and pedagogical issues!!

\paragraph{Differentiation.}
Three courses the first semester:  MAT1100, MAT-INF1100 og INF1100.
\begin{itemize}
\item Definition  of the derivative in  MAT1100 (Calculus and analysis) 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\[
 f'(x)=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithms to compute the derivative in MAT-INF1100  (Mathematical modelling with computing)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\[

\subsection{Example: Computations from day one}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Differentiation and comparison with symbolic expressions.}
Combined with the possibility of symbolic calculations with \emph{Sympy}, Python offers an environment where students and teachers alike can test many different aspects of mathematics and numerical mathematics, in addition to being able to verify and validate their codes. The following simple example shows how to extend the simple function for computing the numerical derivative with the possibility of obtaining the closed form or analytical expression
\bpycod
def differentiate(f, x, h=1E-5, symbolic=False):
    if symbolic:
        import sympy
        return sympy.lambdify([x], sympy.diff(f, x))
    else:
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

\subsection{Other Examples}

\paragraph{Integration by Trapezoidal Rule.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of integration  in MAT1100 (Calculus and analysis).

\item The algorithm for computing the  integral vha the Trapezoidal rule for an interval $x \in [a,b]$
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\[
  \int_a^b(f(x) dx \approx \frac{1}{2}\left [f(a)+2f(a+h)+\dots+2f(b-h)+f(b)\right] 
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Taught   in MAT-INF1100  (Mathematical modelling)

\item The algorithm is then implemented in  INF1100 (programming course).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typical implementation in INF1100}

\paragraph{Integration by Trapezoidal Rule.}

def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)

\paragraph{Symbolic calculations and numerical calculations in one code!}
Python offers an  extremely versatile programming  environment, allowing for the inclusion of analytical studies in a numerical program. Here we show another example
where \emph{SymPy} is used to evaluate the integral and compute the absolute error 
with respect to the numerically evaluated one of the integral
$4\int_0^1 dx/(1+x^2) = \pi$: 
\bpycod
from math import *
from sympy import *
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s

#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)

a = 0.0;  b = 1.0; n = 100
result = Trapez(a,b,function,n)
print "Trapezoidal rule=", result
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, 0.0, 1.0))
print "Sympy integration=", exact
# Find relative error
print "Relative error", abs((exact-result)/exact)
\epycod
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% !split
\subsection{Integrating numerical mathematics with calculus}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The last example shows the potential of combining numerical algorithms with symbolic calculations, allowing thereby students and teachers to

\begin{itemize}
\item Validate and verify  their  algorithms. 

\item Including concepts like unit testing, one has the possibility to test and validate several or all parts of the code.

\item Validation and verification are then included \emph{naturally} and one can develop a better attitude to what is meant with an ethically sound scientific approach.

\item The above example allows the student to also test the mathematical error of the algorithm for the trapezoidal rule by changing the number of integration points. The students get trained from day one to think error analysis. 

\item With an ipython notebook the students can keep exploring similar examples and turn them in as their own notebooks. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% !split
\subsection{Error analysis}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The following extended version of the trapezoidal rule allows the student to plot the relative error by comparing with the exact result. By increasing to $10^8$ points one arrives at a region where numerical errors start to accumulate.
\bpycod
from math import log10
import numpy as np
from sympy import Symbol, integrate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# function for the trapezoidal rule
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s
#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)
# define integration limits
a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
# find result from sympy
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, a, b))
# set up the arrays for plotting the relative error
n = np.zeros(8); y = np.zeros(8);
# find the relative error as function of integration points
for i in range(0, 8, 1):
    npts = 10**i
    result = Trapez(a,b,function,npts)
    RelativeError = abs((exact-result)/exact)
    n[i] = log10(npts); y[i] = log10(RelativeError);   
plt.plot(n,y, 'ro')
plt.xlabel('n')
plt.ylabel('Relative error')
plt.show()

  \item How to make a module

  \item How to read input data flexibly from the command line

  \item How to create graphical/web user interfaces

  \item How to write unit tests (test functions or doctests)

\subsection{Additional benefits: A structure approach to solving problems}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)

\item Programs are run through convenient user interfaces

\item It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing 

\item Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,

\item Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.

\item $N$ cells result in twice as many new individuals $\Delta N$ in

\subsection{Parameter estimation}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item We do not know $r$

 \item How can we estimate $r$ from data?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We can use the difference equation with the experimental data

\[ N^{n+1} = N^n + r\Delta t N^n\]
Say $N^{n+1}$ and $N^n$ are known from data, solve wrt $r$:

\[ r = \frac{N^{n+1}-N^n}{N^n\Delta t} \]

Use experimental data in the fraction, say $t_1=600$, $t_2=1200$,
$N^1=140$, $N^2=250$: $r=0.0013$.

\paragraph{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make our research visible in early undergraduate courses, enhance research based teaching

\item Possibility to focus more on understanding and increased insight.

\item Impetus for broad cooperation in teaching.

\item Strengthening of instruction based teaching (expensive and time-consuming).

\item Give our candidates a broader and more up-to-date education with a problem-based orientation, often requested by potential employers.

\item And perhaps the most important issue: does this enhance the student's insight in the Sciences?
