    "## What do we mean with computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "And this  competence is about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* overview of important, known algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* reproducible science and ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems\n",
    "\n",
    "All these elements (and many more) will hopefully aid you in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process *per se*.    **Writing good reports is a central element in achieving such insights**.    The computational part is actually a central element in your thesis. How do we document that?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The standard situation we meet on a daily basis\n",
    "The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry\n",
    "\n",
    "* To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers. Solve real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhance reasoning about the scientific method\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, a proper presentation of obtained results via good  scientic reports, aids in including all the above aspects.\n",

    "## Some basic ingredients for a successful numerical project/thesis work\n",
    "\n",
    "When building up a numerical project there are several elements you should think of, amongst these we take the liberty of mentioning the following:\n",
    "1. How to structure a code in terms of functions, see slides on clean code later\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How to make a module\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How to read input data flexibly from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How to create graphical/web user interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How to write unit tests (test functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only), in our case you think of a system and a solver class\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)\n",
    "\n",
    "## More basic ingredients\n",
    "The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:\n",
    "1. New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Programs are run through convenient user interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The thesis/report: how to write a good one\n",
    "**What should it contain? A typical structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    " * An abstract where you give the main summary of your work\n",
    "\n",
    " * An introduction where you explain the aims and rationale for the physics case and  what you have done. At the end of the introduction you should give a brief summary of the structure of the report\n",
    "\n",
    " * Theoretical models and technicalities. This is the methods section\n",
    "\n",
    " * Implementation, the software you have developed\n",
    "\n",
    " * Results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    " * Conclusions and perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    " * Appendix with extra material\n",
    "\n",
    " * Bibliography\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep always a good log of what you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, the abstract\n",
    "The abstract gives the reader a quick overview of what has been done and the most important results. [Here is a typical example](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.060403)\n",
    "\n",
    "**As is well known, angular position and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons are a conjugate pair of variables that have been extensively explored for quantum information science and technology. In contrast, the radial degrees of freedom remain relatively unexplored. Here we exploit the radial variables, i.e., radial position and radial momentum, to demonstrate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations between down-converted photons. In our experiment, we prepare various annular apertures to define the radial positions and use eigenmode projection to measure the radial momenta. The resulting correlations are found to violate the Heisenberg-like uncertainty principle for independent particles, thus manifesting the entangled feature in the radial structure of two-photon wave functions. Our work suggests that, in parallel with angular position and OAM, the radial position and radial momentum can offer a new platform for a fundamental test of quantum mechanics and for novel application of quantum information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, the introduction\n",
    "**What should I focus on? Introduction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write the introduction you could focus on the following aspects\n",
    " * Motivate the reader, the first part of the introduction gives always a motivation and tries to give the overarching ideas\n",
    "\n",
    " * What I have done\n",
    "\n",
    " * The structure of the report, how it is organized etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, discussion of methods and your implementation\n",
    "**What should I focus on? Methods sections.**\n",
    "\n",
    " * Describe the methods and algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    " * You need to explain how you implemented the methods and also say something about the structure of your algorithm and present some parts of your code\n",
    "\n",
    " * You should plug in some calculations to demonstrate your code, such as selected runs used to validate and verify your results. The latter is extremely important!!  A reader needs to understand that your code reproduces selected benchmarks and reproduces previous results, either numerical and/or well-known  closed form expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation part is central, this is where most of you will present what you have developed, how you have tested the code, its structure, validation and verification and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, results part\n",
    "**What should I focus on? Results.**\n",
    "\n",
    " * Present your results\n",
    "\n",
    " * Give a critical discussion of your work and place it in the correct context.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Relate your work to other calculations/studies\n",
    "\n",
    " * An eventual reader should be able to reproduce your calculations if she/he wants to do so. All input variables should be properly explained.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Make sure that figures and tables should contain enough information in their captions, axis labels etc so that an eventual reader can gain a first impression of your work by studying figures and tables only.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, conclusions and perspectives\n",
    "**What should I focus on? Conclusions.**\n",
    "\n",
    " * State your main findings and interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    " * Try as far as possible to present perspectives for future work\n",
    "\n",
    " * Try to discuss the pros and cons of the methods and possible improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, appendices\n",
    "**What should I focus on? additional material.**\n",
    "\n",
    " * Additional calculations used to validate the codes\n",
    "\n",
    " * Selected calculations, these can be listed with  few comments\n",
    "\n",
    " * Listing of the code if you feel this is necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "You can consider moving parts of the material from the methods section to the appendix. You can also place additional material on your webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, references\n",
    "**What should I focus on? References.**\n",
    "\n",
    " * Give always references to material you base your work on, either  scientific articles/reports or books.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Refer to articles as: name(s) of author(s), journal, volume (boldfaced), page and year in parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Refer to books as: name(s) of author(s), title of book, publisher, place and year, eventual page numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, figures and tables should be clear with labels on axes and good captions!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where do I find scientific articles, books etc and examples of reports\n",
    " * With a UiO IP number you can access freely all books and scientific journals available at our [University library](http://www.ub.uio.no/)\n",
    "\n",
    " * For scientific articles, go to for example the journal [Physical Review Letters of the American Physical Society](http://journals.aps.org/prl/issues/117/10)\n",
    "\n",
