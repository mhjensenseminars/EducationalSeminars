===== Why is computing comptence important? =====
!bblock   Definition of computing    
With computing I will mean solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical, analytical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.
!eblock


!split
===== Computing competence, what is it? =====
!bblock 
Computing competence has always been a central part of the science and engineering education. Traditionally, such competence meant mastering mathematical methods to solve science problems - by pen and paper. 

Today  our candidates are expected to use all available tools to solve scientific problems; computers primarily, but also pen and paper. 

I will use the term/word algorithms in the broad meaning:  methods (for example mathematical) to solve science problems, with and without computers.
!eblock



!split
===== What is computing competence about?  =====
!bblock   
Computing competence is about

o derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
o understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
o overview of important, known algorithms
o understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems
o reproducible science and ethics
o algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems
!eblock


!split
===== Continuous verse discrete =====
!bblock  
Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models. 

Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models. 

Much of the development of methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and industry, simply because much larger problem classes can be addressed with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies. However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.
!eblock



!split
===== Why should basic university education undergo a shift from classical mathematics to modern computing? =====
!bblock  
o The impact of the computer on mathematics is tremendous: science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing.
o Computing increases the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.
o Computing through programming is excellent training of creativity.
o Computing enhances the understanding of abstractions and generalization.
o Computing decreases the need for special tricks and tedious algebra, and shifts the focus to problem definition, visualization, and "what if" discussions.

The result is a deeper understanding of mathematical modeling. Not only is computing via programming a very powerful tool, it also a great pedagogical aid.
For the mathematical training, there is one major new component among the arguments above: understanding abstractions and generalization. While many of the classical methods developed for continuous models are specialized for a particular problem or a narrow class of problems, computing-based algorithms are often developed for problems in a generic form and hence applicable to a large problem class.
!eblock



!split
===== Key principle in scientific modeling =====
!bblock
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a particular problem.
!eblock


!split
===== Computing competence is central to solving scientific problems =====
!bblock   Definition of computing    
Computing competence represents a central element in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to essentially almost all advanced problems in modern societies. Computing competence is simply central to further progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in deeper insights about scientific problems.

Today's project in science and industry tend to involve larger teams. Tools for reliable collaboration must therefore be mastered (e.g., version control systems, automated computer experiments for reproducibility, software and method documentation).

!eblock


!split
===== Modeling and computations as a way to enhance algorithminc thinking =====
!bblock 

Algorithmic  thinking as a way to

* Enhance instruction based teaching
* Introduce Research based teaching  from day one
* Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines 
* Validation and verification of scientific results (the PRL example), with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central.
* Good working practices from day one.
!eblock



!split
===== Research based teaching =====
!bblock How do we define it?
One possible definition: It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.


* It is the standard situation at all universities  and takes normally place at the senior undergraduate/graduate level (isn't it too late?)
* It is seldom done in undergraduate courses.
* Taught by a researcher
* The student starts seeing the countour of the scientific approach leading her/him to make new interpretations, develop new insights and understandings that lead  to further research.

!eblock



!split
===== Research based education =====
!bblock What should the education contain?
The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:

* Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry
* To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers on closed form. Solve real problems.
* Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.
* Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.

Our education should reflect this.
!eblock



!split
===== Research based education =====
!bblock Normal workflow in Science and Engineering

* A problem is properly described using a precise (normal) language.
* It is translated to a mathematical problem using known laws and  principles.
* It is solved, normally via numerical similations.
* The solution is visualized and analyzed.
* The solution to the problem is formulated.

People who master these skills bring an important compentence to society.

!split
===== Preliminary summary =====
!bblock Computations should enter basic science education

* Computation is a fundamental tool to gain new insights and should be included in our elementary teaching.
* Requires development of algorithmic thinking.
* Basic numerical methods should be part of the compulsory curriculum.
* The students should also learn to develop new numerical methods and adapt to new software tools.
* Requires more training than simple programming in a mathematics course.

!eblock


!split
===== Can we catch many birds with one stone? =====
!bblock
* How can we include and integrate an algorithmic (computational) perspective   in our basic education?
* Can this enhance the students' understanding of mathematics and science?
* Can it strengthen research based teaching?

!eblock


!split
===== What is needed? =====
!bblock Programming
A compulsory programming course with a strong mathematical flavour. *Should give a solid foundation in programming as a problem solving technique in mathematics*. Programming is understanding! The line of thought when solving mathematical problems numerically enhances algorithmic thinking,  and thereby the students' understanding of the scientific process.
!eblock

!bblock Mathematics and numerics
Mathematics is at least as important as before, but should be supplemented with development, analysis, implementation, verification and validation of numerical methods. Science ethics and better understanding of the pedagogical process, almost for free!
!eblock

!bblock Sciences
Training in modelling and problem solving with numerical methods and visualisation, as well as traditional methods in Science courses, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Engineering...
!eblock



!split
===== Implementation =====
!bblock Crucial ingredients

* Support from governing bodies (now priority 1 of the College of Natural Science at UOslo)
* Cooperation across departmental boundaries
* Willingness by individuals to give priority to teaching reform

Consensus driven approach.
!eblock



!split
===== Implementation in Oslo: The CSE  project =====
!bblock What we do
* Coordinated use of computational exercises and numerical tools in most undergraduate courses.
* Help update the scientific staff's competence on computational aspects and give support (scientific, pedagogical and financial)  to those who wish to revise  their courses in a computational direction.
* Teachers get good summer students to aid in introducing computational exercises
* Develop courses and exercise modules with a computational perspective, both for students and teachers. 
* Basic idea: mixture of mathematics, computation, informatics and topics from the physical sciences.
 
Interesting outcome: higher focus on teaching and pedagogical issues!!

!split
===== Example: Computations from day one =====
!bblock Differentiation
Three courses the first semester:  MAT1100, MAT-INF1100 og INF1100.
* Definition  of the derivative in  MAT1100 (Calculus and analysis) 
!bt
\[
 f'(x)=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
\]
!et
* Algorithms to compute the derivative in MAT-INF1100  (Mathematical modelling with computing)
!bt
\[
 f'(x)= \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}+O(h^2).
\]
!et
* Implementation in Python in INF1100
!bc pycod
def differentiate(f, x, h=1E-5):
     return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)
!ec

!eblock

!split
===== Example: Computations from day one =====
!bblock Differentiation and comparison with symbolic expressions
Combined with the possibility of symbolic calculations with *Sympy*, Python offers an environment where students and teachers alike can test many different aspects of mathematics and numerical mathematics, in addition to being able to verify and validate their codes. The following simple example shows how to extend the simple function for computing the numerical derivative with the possibility of obtaining the closed form or analytical expression
!bc pycod
def differentiate(f, x, h=1E-5, symbolic=False):
    if symbolic:
        import sympy
        return sympy.lambdify([x], sympy.diff(f, x))
    else:
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)
!ec

!eblock



!split
===== Other Examples =====
!bblock Integration by Trapezoidal Rule 
 
* Definition of integration  in MAT1100 (Calculus and analysis).
* The algorithm for computing the  integral vha the Trapezoidal rule for an interval $x \in [a,b]$
!bt
\[
  \int_a^b(f(x) dx \approx \frac{1}{2}\left [f(a)+2f(a+h)+\dots+2f(b-h)+f(b)\right] 
\]
!et
* Taught   in MAT-INF1100  (Mathematical modelling)

* The algorithm is then implemented in  INF1100 (programming course).

!eblock

!split
===== Typical implementation first semester of study =====
!bblock Integration by Trapezoidal Rule 

!bc pycod
from math import exp, log, sin
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s

def f1(x):
    return exp(-x*x)*log(1+x*sin(x))

a = 1;  b = 3; n = 1000
result = Trapez(a,b,f1,n)
print result
!ec
!eblock


!split
===== Symbolic calculations and numerical calculations in one code  =====
!bblock 
Python offers an  extremely versatile programming  environment, allowing for
the inclusion of analytical studies in a numerical program. Here we show an
example code with the _trapezoidal rule_ using _SymPy_ to evaluate an integral and compute the absolute error
with respect to the numerically evaluated one of the integral
$4\int_0^1 dx/(1+x^2) = \pi$:
!bc pyscpro
from math import *
from sympy import *
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s

#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)

a = 0.0;  b = 1.0; n = 100
result = Trapez(a,b,function,n)
print "Trapezoidal rule=", result
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, 0.0, 1.0))
print "Sympy integration=", exact
# Find relative error
print "Relative error", abs((exact-result)/exact)
!ec
!eblock




!split
===== Error analysis =====
!bblock 
The following extended version of the trapezoidal rule allows you  to plot the relative error by comparing with the exact result. By increasing to $10^8$ points one arrives at a region where numerical errors start to accumulate.
!bc pyscpro
from math import log10
import numpy as np
from sympy import Symbol, integrate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# function for the trapezoidal rule
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s
#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)
# define integration limits
a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
# find result from sympy
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, a, b))
# set up the arrays for plotting the relative error
n = np.zeros(9); y = np.zeros(9);
# find the relative error as function of integration points
for i in range(1, 8, 1):
    npts = 10**i
    result = Trapez(a,b,function,npts)
    RelativeError = abs((exact-result)/exact)
    n[i] = log10(npts); y[i] = log10(RelativeError);
plt.plot(n,y, 'ro')
plt.xlabel('n')
plt.ylabel('Relative error')
plt.show()
!ec
!eblock


!split
===== Integrating numerical mathematics with calculus =====
!bblock 
The last example shows the potential of combining numerical algorithms with symbolic calculations, allowing thereby students and teachers to

* Validate and verify  their  algorithms. 
* Including concepts like unit testing, one has the possibility to test and validate several or all parts of the code.
* Validation and verification are then included *naturally* and one can develop a better attitude to what is meant with an ethically sound scientific approach.
* The above example allows the student to also test the mathematical error of the algorithm for the trapezoidal rule by changing the number of integration points. The students get trained from day one to think error analysis. 
* With an ipython notebook the students can keep exploring similar examples and turn them in as their own notebooks.

!split
===== Additional benefits: A structured approach to solving problems =====
!bblock 
In this process we easily bake in
 o   How to structure a code in terms of functions
 o   How to make a module
 o   How to read input data flexibly from the command line
 o   How to create graphical/web user interfaces
 o   How to write unit tests (test functions or doctests)
 o   How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only)
 o   How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments
 o   How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)
!eblock


!split
===== Additional benefits: A structure approach to solving problems =====
!bblock 
The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:
 o New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)
 o Programs are run through convenient user interfaces
 o It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing 
 o Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,
 o Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.
!eblock




!split
===== Learning outcomes three first semesters =====
!bblock Knowledge of basic algorithms

* Differential equations: Euler, modified Euler and Runge-Kutta methods (first semester)
* Numerical integration: Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule, multidimensional integrals (first semester)
* Random numbers, random walks, probability distributions and Monte Carlo integration  (first semester)
* Linear Algebra and eigenvalue problems: Gaussian elimination, LU-decomposition, SVD, QR, Givens rotations and eigenvalues, Gauss-Seidel. (second and third semester)
* Root finding and interpolation etc. (all three first semesters)
* Processing of sound and images (first semester).

The students have to code several of these algorithms during the first three semesters.
!eblock


!split
===== Later courses =====
!bblock

_Later courses should build on this foundation as much as possible_.

o In particular, the course should not be too basic! There should be progression in the use of mathematics, numerical methods and programming, as well as science.


o Computational platform: Python, fully object-oriented and allows for seamless integration of c++ and Fortran codes, as well as Matlab-like programming environment. Makes it easy to parallelize codes as well.

* Molecular dynamics simulations etc etc 

!eblock


!split
===== Challenges...  =====
!bblock .. and objections

*Standard objection: computations take away the attention from other central topics in 'my course'*. 

CSE incorporates computations from day one, and courses higher up do not need to
spend time on computational topics  (technicalities), but can focus on the interesting
science applications.

* To help teachers: Developed pedagogical modules which can aid university teachers. Own course for teachers.

!eblock

!split
===== Challenges and future plans =====
!bblock

* The project depends crucially on few individuals. 
* Need to get more teachers involved, not only good TAs.
* How  to implement a CSE perspective in other programs like Chemistry, Molecular Biology,  Biology, Engineering. New courses are being developed.
* Now a national pilot for other universities and regional colleges.

_Key issue: modularization of topics and development of a 'technological platform' which glues together different modules_

!eblock

!split
===== Which aspects are important for a successful introduction of CSE? =====
!bblock

===== How to teach computing in biology? =====

!bblock
Do we need to still follow the tradition and teach mathematics, physics, computations, chemistry, etc. in separate discipline-specific courses?

  * Uninteresting to first study tools when you want to study biology

!eblock


!split
===== The pedagogical framework =====

!bblock Aim: Develop intuition about the scientific method

===== Concepts must be introduced implicitly in a structured way =====

!bblock
 * Always identify new concepts
 * Train new concepts in simplified (``trivial'') problems
!eblock
!bblock 
Concepts in the previous example:
 * Lists or arrays of numbers
 * Plotting commands
 * Curve = function of time
!eblock

!bnotice
The concept of a continuous function $N(t)$ is not necessary,
just straight lines between discrete points on a curve.

===== Read data from file =====

!bblock
!bc pypro
import numpy as np
data = np.loadtxt('ecoli.csv', delimiter=',')

===== How can we reason about the process? =====

# http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/Thoc/PopGrowth.html

!bblock
!bpop
 o Cells divide after $T$ seconds on average (one generation)
 o $2N$ celles divide into twice as many new cells $\Delta N$ in a time
   interval $\Delta t$ as $N$ cells would: $\Delta N \propto N$
 o $N$ cells result in twice as many new individuals $\Delta N$ in
   time $2\Delta t$ as in time $\Delta t$: $\Delta N \propto\Delta t$
 o Same proportionality wrt death (repeat reasoning)
 o Proposed model: $\Delta N = b\Delta t N - d\Delta tN$ for some unknown
   constants $b$ (births) and $d$ (deaths)
 o Describe evolution in discrete time: $t_n=n\Delta t$
 o Program-friendly notation: $N$ at $t_n$ is $N^n$
 o Math model: $N^{n+1} = N^n + r\Delta t\, N$ (with $\ r=b-d$)
 o Program model: `N[n+1] = N[n] + r*dt*N[n]`

!split
===== Parameter estimation =====

!bblock
 * We do not know $r$
 * How can we estimate $r$ from data?

We can use the difference equation with the experimental data

!bt
\[ N^{n+1} = N^n + r\Delta t N^n\]
!et
Say $N^{n+1}$ and $N^n$ are known from data, solve wrt $r$:

!bt
\[ r = \frac{N^{n+1}-N^n}{N^n\Delta t} \]
!et

Use experimental data in the fraction, say $t_1=600$, $t_2=1200$,
$N^1=140$, $N^2=250$: $r=0.0013$.
!eblock

!bnotice More sophisticated methods
Can do a nonlinear least squares parameter fit, but that is
too advanced at this stage.

===== Discuss the nature of such a model =====

!bblock
 * Write up all the biological factors that influence the
   population size of bacteria
 * Understand that all such effects are merged into one parameter $r$
 * Understand that the reasoning must be the same whether we
   have bacteria, animals or humans - this is a generic model!<linebreak>

 * How many bacteria in the lab after one month?
 * Growth is restricted by environmental resources!
 * Fix the model (logistic growth)
 * Is the logistic model appropriate for a lab experiment?
 * Find data to support the logistic model <linebreak>
   (it's a *very* simple model)

===== The pedagogical template (to be iterated!) =====

!bblock
 * Start with a real biological problem
 * Be careful with too many new concepts
 * Workflow:
  * data
  * visualization
  * patterns
  * modeling (*discrete*)
  * programming
  * testing
  * parameter estimation (difficult)
  * validation
  * prediction
 * Make many small exercises that train the new concepts
 * Repeat the case in a way that makes a complete understanding

===== Summary =====
!bblock

* Make our research visible in early undergraduate courses, enhance research based teaching
* Possibility to focus more on understanding and increased insight.
* Impetus for broad cooperation in teaching.
* Strengthening of instruction based teaching (expensive and time-consuming).
* Give our candidates a broader and more up-to-date education with a problem-based orientation, often requested by potential employers.
* And perhaps the most important issue: does this enhance the student's insight in the Sciences?
