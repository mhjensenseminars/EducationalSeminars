===== Motivation  =====
!bblock
* Develop structured courses/modules which will provide our students with a modern education in nuclear physics
* Modules/courses should contain a high-level of synchronization
* A computational perspective is essential
* Can the  FRIB theory alliance can function as the national coordinating unit?
* Coordination with the "Nuclear TALENT":"http://www.nucleartalent.org" initiative? 
* Develop learning outcomes?

_What are our needs and how do we contribute to the community as a whole?_

===== Local situation at MSU  =====
!bblock

We have at MSU a  
* "basic survey course PHY802":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~witek/Classes/PHY802/NuclPhys802-2015.html"  and three basic nuclear physics courses 
* "structure":"http://nuclearstructure.github.io/PHY981/doc/web/course.html", 
* "reactions and dynamics":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~nunes/phy982/phy982web2015.htm"  and 
* "Nuclear Astrophysics":"https://reg.msu.edu/Courses/Request.aspx?SubjectCode=PHY&CourseNumber=983&Source=SB&Term=1156". 

These  basic courses have a duration each  of 30-40 hours (2-3 credits).   



They are taught as regular one semester courses. There are also experimental courses not discussed here.

We have also an advanced course on Special topics in Nuclear Physics, reaction theory, PHY 989.

===== Advanced  modules and more needs, NSCL  =====
!bblock 

* PHY 989 Special topics in nuclear physics, fall 2015 (Pawel and Bill), advanced reaction theory
* Alex Brown has suggested a special course on Nuclear shell model studies, based on the background (and learning outcomes) from PHY 981, nuclear structure
* We will most likely need an advanced module on field theory (LQCD, electroweak theory, fundamental symmetries)
!eblock

!split
===== Student background and our education =====
!bblock

* Heterogenous group of students with varying background
  * Only few students have a good training in scientific computing
  * Learn computing by looking at recipes, no deep learning and competence
  * Difficult to transfer to new problems

* Need a more coherent education in computational science and physics
  * FRIB/NSCL adn PA in collaboration with CSME develop strategies for including computational elements in basic education and graduate education. 

_Computing competence is in general weak or lacks totally._ 
!eblock


!split 
=====  Courses in computational science and physics =====
!bblock
* "Computational Physics PHY 480/905(section 002)":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU"
* PHY 905 (section 004) High-performance computing"
* Scattered elements of computations here and there (_not a complete list_)
  * PHY 981 Nuclear structure: students write a Hartree-Fock program and a shell-model program
  * PHY 982 Nuclear dynamics: students analyse nuclear reactions using FRESCO 

Many possible paths in order to improve the situation:
* Proper graduate course(s) in computational physics
* Computational projects in nuclear physics courses
* Most "Nuclear Talent":"http://www.nucleartalent.org" courses have computational projects

===== To think of =====
!bblock 
* How many basic courses can an institution offer, and which courses should be offered?
* How can the coming FRIB theory alliance be used to coordinate an advanced training in nuclear physics?
* How to integrate the (*ad hoc*) Nuclear Talent courses/initiative  in our education? 
* Most courses offered are theoretical ones. We need a better coordination between theory and experiment.  
* Is it possible to integrate material developed in different Talent courses, offering thereby a coherent source for educating the next generation of nuclear physicists? Keyword: Modularization of topics.
* Role of computations.
