===== Motivation and questions  =====
!bblock
* Develop structured courses/modules which will provide our students with a modern education in nuclear physics
* Modules/courses should contain a high-level of synchronization
* A computational perspective is essential. In 2020 it is expected that one out two jobs in the STEM fields will be within computing
* What kind of competences should our students have?
* Should we develop learning outcomes?

_What are our needs and how do we contribute to the community as a whole?_

===== Local situation at MSU  =====
!bblock

We have at MSU a  
* "basic survey course PHY802":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~witek/Classes/PHY802/NuclPhys802-2015.html"  and three basic nuclear physics courses 
* "structure":"http://nuclearstructure.github.io/PHY981/doc/web/course.html", 
* "reactions and dynamics":"https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~nunes/phy982/phy982web2015.htm"  and 
* "Nuclear Astrophysics":"https://reg.msu.edu/Courses/Request.aspx?SubjectCode=PHY&CourseNumber=983&Source=SB&Term=1156". 

These  basic courses have a duration each  of 30-40 hours (2-3 credits).   

We have also an advanced course on Special topics in Nuclear Physics, reaction theory, PHY 989.

===== Advanced  modules and more needs, NSCL  =====
!bblock 

* PHY 989 Special topics in nuclear physics, fall 2015 (Pawel and Bill), advanced reaction theory
* Alex taught PHY 989 on Nuclear shell model studies, based on the background (and learning outcomes) from PHY 981, nuclear structure, fall 2016
* Scott B and MHJ taught a 2 credit module on nuclear forces fall 2017. Bill Lynch and Pawel taught also PHY 989 with an emphasis on advanced reaction theory topics

===== Student background and our education =====
!bblock

* Heterogenous group of students with varying background
  * Only few students have a good training in scientific computing
  * Learn computing by looking at recipes, no deep learning and competence
  * Difficult to transfer to new problems

* Need a more coherent education in computational science and physics
  * FRIB/NSCL and PA in collaboration with CSME develop strategies for including computational elements in basic education and graduate education. Dual PhD. 

_Computing competence is in general weak or lacks totally._

!split
===== What about recommending the following to our graduate students? =====
!bblock

* Basic courses
  o PHY 802
  o PHY 981
  o PHY 982
* Additional knowledge and courses
  o Quantum field theory
  o Course on Nuclear Forces (not every year), from LQCD to EFT
  o Advanced module on nuclear structure and reacton theories
  o Many-body theory for the nuclear many-body problem 
  o More
* The dual PhD with CMSE as a way to enhance the computing skills
!eblock


!split
===== To think of =====
!bblock 
* How many basic courses can an institution offer, and which courses should be offered?
* How can the coming FRIB theory alliance be used to coordinate an advanced training in nuclear physics?
* How to integrate the (*ad hoc*) Nuclear Talent courses/initiative  in our education? 
* Most courses offered are theoretical ones. We need a better coordination between theory and experiment.  
* Is it possible to integrate material developed in different Talent courses, offering thereby a coherent source for educating the next generation of nuclear physicists? Keyword: Modularization of topics.
* Role of computations.
