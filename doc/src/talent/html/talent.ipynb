    "**The TALENT initiative aims at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory and experiment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The network aims at developing a broad curriculum that will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding nuclei and nuclear reactions. These objectives are being met by offering intensive three-week courses on a rotating set of topics, commissioned from experienced teachers in nuclear theory and experiment. The educational material generated under this program will be collected in the form of web-based courses, [textbooks](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319533353), and a variety of modern educational resources. No such all-encompassing material is available at present; its development will allow dispersed university groups to profit from the best expertise available.\n",
