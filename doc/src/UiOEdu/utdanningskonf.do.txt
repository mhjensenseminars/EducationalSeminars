* Overarching view on active learning, project based approach, problem based learning (PBL) etc
* What do we mean with research based education and how to introduce it as early as possible? 
* How to develop deeper insights in a specific discipline
* How to integrate an active learning approach with proper learning and assessment criterias

!bblock Overarching Motivation
Excellent research depends on excellent education --- and vice versa!

===== Active or passive Learning, or a Mix? =====

!bblock
Active learning can be defined as an approach to learning wherein the
students engage themselves in the learning process by developing
knowledge and understanding. It demands full-fledged participation on
the part of the learner and is not based on classroom teaching, rather
it is based on interactive learning sessions.

===== Passive Learning =====

!bblock
Passive Learning means the traditional form of learning wherein teachers are seen as experts and they are expected to transfer knowledge to the learners. Hence, the students have a laid-back attitude, as they learn from what is taught to them by their instructor. Moreover, the student does normally not get any feedback from the instructor.

There is growing evidence that an active learning environment leads to deeper insights and knowledge

=====  Project based Courses and Project-based Learning =====

!bblock Some standard elements in  project-based courses (PBC)

o The audiences for projects are generally at the university

o Are traditionally more about the end-product and less about the learning and process

o The project is pre-planned and clear

o The project is based on specific directions and criteria

o The project can be done at home without teacher guidance or collaboration

o The project can be outlined in details

o Can be  less open-ended and more uniform

o Projects are *turned in* rather than *published*, presented, or otherwise managed on an ongoing basis. They are normally graded

=====  More on Project based Courses and Project-based Learning =====

!bblock Some standard elements in  project-based learning (PBL)

o In PBL, the audience is generally outside the university/school

o PBL includes *need to knows* and progress checkpoints

o Input from peers, teachers, community members, experts, and others can help guide and improve the project

o The *teacher work* is done mainly before and during the process itself

o PBL Is often based on a driving question and ongoing inquiry, discovery, and iteration

o PBL depends on background knowledge, learner choice, technology tools, support from others, and dozens of other factors that result in a process of learning that produces very different results and projects


PBL requires a lot of planning in advance and coordination of teaching teams an students.  My experience is that this applies to PBC as well.

===== Research based Teaching =====
!bblock How do we define it? 

One possible definition: It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.

o It is the standard situation at all universities  and takes normally place at the senior undergraduate/graduate level (isn't it too late?)
o It is seldom done in undergraduate courses.
o Taught by a researcher
o The student starts seeing the countour of the scientific approach leading her/him to make new interpretations, develop new insights and understandings that lead  to further research.

===== More on Research based Education  =====

!bblock What should the education contain?
The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis (STEM related examples):
o Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry
o To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers on closed form. Solve real problems.
o Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.
o Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.

Our education should reflect this. How does this transfer to your discipline?

===== Some final Words on Research based Education =====

!bblock Normal workflow in STEM fields
o A problem is properly described using a precise (normal) language.
o It is translated to a mathematical problem using known laws and principles.
o It is solved, normally via numerical similations.
o The solution is visualized and analyzed.
o The solution to the problem is formulated.
People who master these skills bring an important compentence to society. Gain via increased efficiency and quality due to interdisciplinarity at a more detailed level. 

Question: how does this translate into your discipline?
