\subsection{Motivation}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop structured modules which will provide our students with a modern education in nuclear physics

\item Modules/courses should contain a high-level of synchronization

\item A computational perspective is essential

\item The FRIB theory center can function as the national coordinating unit

\item Coordination with the \href{{http://www.nucleartalent.org}}{Nuclear TALENT} initiative
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Local situation at MSU}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

We have at MSU a  
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{{https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~witek/Classes/PHY802/NuclPhys802-2015.html}}{basic survey course PHY802}  and three basic nuclear physics courses 

\item \href{{http://nuclearstructure.github.io/PHY981/doc/web/course.html}}{structure}, 

\item \href{{https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~nunes/phy982/phy982web2015.htm}}{reactions and dynamics}  and 

\item \textbf{Nuclear Astrophysics}. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These three basic courses have a duration each  of 30-40 hours (2-3 credits).   

They can be taught as a regular one-semester course or half-semester course. There are also experimental courses not discussed here.

\subsection{To think of}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
\item How many basic courses can an institution offer, and which courses should be offered?

\item How can the coming FRIB theory center be used to coordinate an advanced training in nuclear physics?

\item Can we integrate the (\emph{ad hoc}) Nuclear Talent courses/initiative  in our education? 

\item \textbf{Nuclear Talent initiative and Asia} 

\item Most courses offered are theoretical ones. We need a better coordination between theory and experiment. Should we think of an experimental Talent initiative? 

\item Is it possible to integrate material developed in different Talent courses, offering thereby a coherent source for educating the next generation of nuclear physicists? Keyword: Modularization of topics.
\end{itemize}
