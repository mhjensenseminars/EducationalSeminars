\subsection{Parameter estimation}

\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item We do not know $r$

 \item How can we estimate $r$ from data?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We can use the difference equation with the experimental data

\[ N^{n+1} = N^n + r\Delta t N^n\]
Say $N^{n+1}$ and $N^n$ are known from data, solve wrt $r$:

\[ r = \frac{N^{n+1}-N^n}{N^n\Delta t} \]

Use experimental data in the fraction, say $t_1=600$, $t_2=1200$,
$N^1=140$, $N^2=250$: $r=0.0013$.

Can do a nonlinear least squares parameter fit, but that is
too advanced at this stage.

\subsection{Discuss the nature of such a model}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Write up all the biological factors that influence the
   population size of bacteria

 \item Understand that all such effects are merged into one parameter $r$

 \item Understand that the reasoning must be the same whether we
   have bacteria, animals or humans - this is a generic model!\\
   (even the interest rate in a bank follows the same model)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discuss the limitations of such a model}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item How many bacteria in the lab after one month?

 \item Growth is restricted by environmental resources!

 \item Fix the model (logistic growth)

 \item Is the logistic model appropriate for a lab experiment?

 \item Find data to support the logistic model \\
   (it's a \emph{very} simple model)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% !split
\subsection{The pedagogical template (to be iterated!)}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Start with a real biological problem

 \item Be careful with too many new concepts

 \item Workflow:
\begin{itemize}

  \item data

  \item visualization

  \item patterns

  \item modeling (\emph{discrete})

  \item programming

  \item testing

  \item parameter estimation (difficult)

  \item validation

  \item prediction

\end{itemize}

\noindent
 \item Make many small exercises that train the new concepts

 \item Repeat the case in a way that makes a complete understanding
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% !split
\subsection{Technology for documenting cases}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Documentation: slides in the doconce format with extra notes\\
   (can compile with/without notes)

 \item Realistic goal: write out the slides for a gentle book on biocomputing examples

 \item The biological case is in a separate file that the students can work
   with as an IPython notebook

 \item Problem: not much basic literature exists

 \item Cases must be linked in a learning graph:\\
   \emph{I want to do nerve cell modeling, but how to progress to this stage?}

 \item Make a list of concepts and where concepts are trained

 \item Think of each case as a \emph{separate module}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% !split
\subsection{Immediate tasks}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Find a good bacteria growth lab example - do the first example

 \item Alternative model: random 2D walk, people meet and make new individuals

 \item Predator-pray model: any field experiment to build?

 \item Experiments based on technology: imaging, sensors, ...

 \item Disease modeling coupled to data

 \item Predator-pray with disease

 \item Bioinformatics cases and programming

classical example shown in many biology textbooks when ecological
systems are discussed. The system contains all elements of the
scientific method:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The set up of a specific hypothesis combined with

 \item the experimental methods needed (one can study existing data or perform experiments)

 \item analyzing and interpreting the data and performing further experiments if needed

 \item trying to extract general behaviors and extract eventual laws or patterns

 \item develop mathematical relations for the uncovered regularities/laws and test these by performing new experiments

 \item $L$ the number of predators

 \item $a$, $b$, $d$, $c$ are parameters

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{The bottom-up approach.}
% !bpop
\begin{itemize}
 \item Start with experimental data and discuss the methods which have been used to collect the data, the assumptions, the electronic devices, the aims etc. That is, expose the students to the theory and assumptions behind the data that have been collected and motivate for the scientific method.

 \item Where appropriate the students should do the experiment(s) needed to collect the data.

 \item The first programming tasks are to read and visualize the data to see if there are patterns or regularities. This strengthens a research-driven intuition.

 \item Now we want to increase the understanding through modeling.

 \item Most of the biology lies in the \emph{derivation} of the model. We shall
   focus on an intuitive discrete approach that leads to difference
   equations that can be programmed \emph{and solved} directly.

 \item $L^n$: population of lynx at time $t_n$

 \item We want to model the changes in populations, $\Delta H=H^{n+1}-H^n$
   and $\Delta L=L^{n+1}-L^n$ during a general time interval $[t_{n+1},t_n]$

\subsection{Basic dynamics of the population of hares}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The population of hares evolves due to births and deaths exactly as a bacteria population:

\[
\Delta H = a \Delta t H^n
\]
However, hares have an additional loss in the population because
they are eaten by lynx.
All the hares and lynx can form
$H\cdot L$ pairs in total. When such pairs meet during a time
interval $\Delta t$, there is some
small probablity that the lynx will eat the hare.
So in fraction $b\Delta t HL$, the lynx eat hares. This
loss of hares and must be accounted for:
subtracted in the equation for hares:

\[ \Delta H = a\Delta t H^n - b \Delta t H^nL^n\]

\subsection{Basic dynamics of the population of lynx}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
We assume that the primary growth for the lynx population depends on sufficient food for raising lynx kittens, which implies an adequate source of nutrients from predation on hares. Thus, the growth of the lynx population does not only depend of how many lynx there are, but on how many hares they can eat.
In a time interval $\Delta t HL$ hares and lynx can meet, and in a
fraction $b\Delta t HL$ the lynx eats the hare. All of this does not
contribute to the growth of lynx, again just a fraction of
$b\Delta t HL$ that we write as
$d\Delta t HL$. In addition, lynx die just as in the population
dynamics with one isolated animal population, leading to a loss
$-c\Delta t L$.

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The accounting of lynx then looks like
\[ \Delta L = d\Delta t H^nL^n - c\Delta t L^n\]

\subsection{Evolution equations}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
By writing up the definition of $\Delta H$ and $\Delta L$, and putting
all assumed known terms $H^n$ and $L^n$ on the right-hand side, we have

\[ H^{n+1} = H^n + a\Delta t H^n - b\Delta t H^n L^n \]

\[ L^{n+1} = L^n + d\Delta t H^nL^n - c\Delta t L^n \]

Note:

\begin{itemize}
 \item These equations are ready to be implemented!

 \item But to start, we need $H^0$ and $L^0$ \\
   (which we can get from the data)

 \item We also need values for $a$, $b$, $d$, $c$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adapt the model to the Hudson Bay case}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item As always, models tend to be general - as here, applicable
   to ``all'' predator-pray systems

 \item The critical issue is whether the \emph{interaction} between hares and lynx
   is sufficiently well modeled by $\hbox{const}HL$

 \item The parameters $a$, $b$, $d$, and $c$ must be
   estimated from data

 \item Measure time in years

 \item $t_0=1900$, $t_m=1920$
\end{itemize}
