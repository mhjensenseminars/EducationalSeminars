===== Why should we focus on Computational Science and Data Science? =====
!bblock
* "By 2020, it is expected that one of every two jobs in the STEM fields will be in computing":"http://pathways.acm.org/executive-summary.html" (Association for Computing Machinery, 2013)
* Computation is an essential and cross-cutting element of all STEM disciplines
* Computational science and Data science have developed into  disciplines of their own right
* Computations and the understanding of large data sets play an even larger role in basically all disciplines of STEM fields, Medicine, the Social Sciences, the Humanities and  education
* Students at both undergraduate and graduate level are unprepared to use computational modeling, data science, and high performance computing â€“ skills valued by a very broad range of employers.
* The 3rd Industrial Revolution will alter significantly the demands on the workforce. To adapt a highly-qualified workforce to coming challenges  requires strong fundamental bases in STEM fields. Computational Science and Data Science can provide such bases at all stages.

===== Education: Computational Science and Data Science  at Norwegian  universities =====
!bblock
In Norway it is only UiO which offers  Master of Science  programs in
"Computational Science":"https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/computational-science-master/index.html" and "Data Science":"https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/datascience-master/index.html". All other universities have
only Master programs in Computer Science, with minor emphasis on computational science and/or data science. 
The University of Bergen has
a Masters program in Applied Mathematics while UMB has a newly
established program in computational science and data science. UiS is planning a new MSc program in computational science with start 2019.

Nationally, UiO is the only university which offers
broad programs in Computational Science and Data Science.

Out of 95 universities polled in the USA, there are less than 15 which have a department on Scientific Computing
and more than 50 that have a center on Scientific Computing. Between 20 to 30 of these offer a bachelor, Master of Science or PhD program. On Data Science there are approximately 30 departments and 40 centers. Almost 50 of these universities offer a Masters degree in Data Science and close to 40 a PhD in Data Science.

* Develop a comprehensive set of courses and degree programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels that will give students across the university exposure to practical computational methods, understanding how to analyse data and more generally to the idea of computers as problem-solving tools. 

* Develop an all university PhD program in Computational Science and Data Science (with dual degrees/certificates)

* Develop an all university Bachelor and Master of Science Program in Computational Science and Data Science

* Develop courses and course  modules in Computational Science and Data Science for the private and the public sectors

* Develop a PhD program in Computational Science and Data Science tailored to the needs of the private and the public sectors

* Facilitate the adoption of computational tools and techniques for both research and education across campus, through education and faculty collaboration. 

* "Educate the next generation of school teachers and university teachers,  with a strong focus on digital competences":"https://www.realfagsforlaget.no/publikasjoner".

===== A new all university bachelor program in computational science and data science =====

This program has a compulsory mathematics, computational science  and data science set of courses. It aims thus at recruiting students who want to deepen their knowledge in 
computational science and data science but with applications to various STEM fields, the Humanities, Social Sciences etc. Medicine and Law are less likely since they have a higher  degree of compulsory courses.
